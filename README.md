# Alex Lin's notes of certain texts.

## Some of these texts include:

- *Transformers for Machine Learning: A Deep Dive* by Kenneth L. Graham, Uday Kamath, Wael Emara
- *Open-FinLLMs: Open Multimodal Large Language Models for Financial Applications* by Anonymous authors
- *Survey of Large Language Models in Finance* by Jean Lee, Nicholas Stevens, Soyeon Caren Han, Minseok Song

### These articles served to help me learn about transformers, LLMs, and FinLLMs during my learning period, as this is my first year on Open-FinLLMs and I required pre-training before I could operate and experiment with the language models. There are three markdown files each documenting my findings on the texts.


# I use Google Sheets to record data for different models that I find by running tasks with the models on a Google Colab script and documenting how well they perform.

## The models that I use include:
